## Key Features:
- The search engine screen allows the user to enter a keyword and get a list of recipes via an API request, while providing an intuitive user interface for easy interaction and understanding of the application's functionality.
- Unit tests to verify successful access to the database to search for recipes. They check that the fetchData(with:) method in the RecipeViewModel correctly sends a request to the API and processes the received data.
- UI tests to test user interaction with the interface. They check that after entering a search query and clicking the search button, the table with recipes is displayed and there are cells with recipes in it.
